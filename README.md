# Arduino-MP3Player
Simple MP3 player that uses a rotary encoder, a seven segment display and the DFTPlayer module.

Most of the code is already available in many websites, I tried to credit them as much as I could. My final product didn't require any volume changes or song skips since it didn't have any buttons, but I left the functions there in case you use them.
